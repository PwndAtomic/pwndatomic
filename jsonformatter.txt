Some of its features:\n\n• Freeze your last seen and control your read receipts;\n• Keep your contacts deleted messages and statuses;\n• Status Add-ons: Never let your friends know that you viewed their statuses – Download any status – disable auto-advance – Privacy contact groups;\n• Auto-reply can reply to your messages automatically;\n• Schedule messages to be sent at a specific date and time;\n• Blacklist some contacts in order to stop receiving & showing their messages in the chats but instead read their messages in a private location;\n• Voice/Video call buttons will let you pick whether you want to WA call or carrier call;\n• Set app passcode or by TouchID – or just lock a specific chat;\n• Compose a chat by just inserting the phone number instead of creating a new contact;\n• Group button to show all your groups together;\n• View contact's profile picture by tapping on it from the chat list;\n• New Watusi sharing sheet will change your WhatsApp sharing experience;\n• Send unlimited number of photos at once;\n• Shrink those large emojis back;\n• Hide any button that annoys your WhatsApp usage;\n• Customize your WhatsApp notifications in many ways like replacing the icon with your contact’s profile picture;\n• Change the app and chats theme by picking any fonts & colors you like;\n• And much, much more!\n\nThe tweak is available in English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish.\n\nConfigure options from inside WhatsApp settings.\n\nSTALKY DESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to check your friends recent status and profile picture updates on WhatsApp? Here's a tweak that will add all your contacts updates into one page where you can view the images and read statuses updates.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Get a list of all your friends updates sorted by time;\n• Filter updates list to show only about/picture/group/statuses updates;\n• A seperate list for your favorites contacts;\n• Access all your contact saved profile pictures;\n• Save/share your contact profile pictures by using long press gesture on the update cell;\n• Copy/share your contact status updates just by tapping on the cell.\n\nNote:\n\nWhatsApp server will hold only one profile picture for every contact, therefore if your contact has changed his picture multiple times when your WhatsApp was closed, we are unable to fetch the old images once you open WhatsApp again. \nThis is why 'Background Fetch' feature is there, it will just let your WhatsApp active in background in order to download your contact picture changes directly as they are updated.",
